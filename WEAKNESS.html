<p> Let's talk about my weakness. My only weakness is cockroaches. I don't know but cockroaches disgust me especially when it's flying.</p>
<p> When I see a cockroach even if it's far from me, I already feel disgusting. I hate it's feet and makes me cringe.</p>
<p> This is my only weakness. For me, this is the most disgusting insect.
