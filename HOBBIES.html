<p> My favorite hobbies are watching kdrama and playing mobile games, example is call of duty mobile.</P>
<P> These are the hobbies I am doing when I am bored in my house or when I'm done with my homework. Sometimes the dawn reaches me when I am watching kdrama or call of duty.</P>
 These hobbies are also my stress reliever. I'm doing these also with my friends when we have time for each other.
