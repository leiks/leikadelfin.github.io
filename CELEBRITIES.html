<P> This is BTS and Han So Hee. I have been a fan of BTS since 2017. I just saw a video of them on facebook then it makes me curious of them.</p>
<p> I searched them up and only to find out that they are famous and some of my friends are fans of them. So, until now I am a fan of them.</p>
<p> The other one is Han So Hee. I became a fan of her because of one of her kdrama. She is so pretty and down to earth. I really love her personality.</p>
<p> Her acting skills are so good. Hoping to have more opportunities in acting and projects.
