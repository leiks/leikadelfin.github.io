 <p>My first strong point is being an ambivert. I feel shy when I am with people that I don't totally know but when I am with my real friends, I can freely show myself like I'm loud when I am laughing. </p>
 <p>My second strong point is working hard. It might be hard for me but I can do it. I am working and trying hard to finish and to do my work. I am doing this for my dreams. </p>
 <p>My last strong point is dreaming. Everyone has their dreams, including me. I have many dreams. I want to travel, to finish my study and to take that degree, and to pay back time for my parents who supported and worked hard to give me a best life.
